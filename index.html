							Before we talk about e-voting systems we need to consider what secure means in this context.
							An e-voting system has to be verifiable; meaning that a voter can be certain that their vote was correctly received and tallied.
							A lot of research has been done in this area; less so for the second property such a system needs to achieve: privacy. 
							As in today's paper ballot systems e-voting should preserve the privacy of the vote.

						</ol>
						<aside class="notes">
							Let's first consider how a generic e-voting system works.
							The process can be separated into three main steps.
							Vote creation is everything up to the encryption of the voter's choice.
							The voter needs to send their vote to the server, also called the bulletin board.
							The third and final step is tallying up all the votes into their total scores. 
							There are two main ways to tally the votes used in modern e-voting systems.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p style="color: #1b91ff">3. Tally</p>
						<h3>Homomorphic tallying</h3>
						<svg width="500" height="200">
							<text font-size="25" x="250" y="100">$ \{1\}_k + \{0\}_k + \{1\}_k= \{2\}_k $</text>
						</svg>
						<p>ZKP: 0 or 1</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							In both types we have an underlying homomorphic encryption system.
							Additive homomorphic encryption has the homomorphic property that two ciphertexts can be added together while encrypted resulting in the encrypted sum.
							This property is used in homomorphic tallying as seen on the slide.
							The three ciphertexts, encoding a 0 or a 1, are added together resulting in the final encrypted tally of 2.
							For homomorphic tallying to work the voter has to provide zero-knowledge proofs that they correctly encrypted a valid choice.
							Else one could encode a 5 leading to a vote 5 times more powerful than a honest voter.
							In this case the voter proofs that they encrypted either a 0 or a 1.
							Because of the needed proofs homomorphic tallying cannot be used for more complex election modes such as ranked voting as there are no simple ways to encode the ranking in a provable format.

								</svg>				
							</div>
						</div>

						<aside class="notes">
							The second tally type is a re-encryption mix-net.
							As the name suggests the mix-net uses re-encryption which is a property derived from the homomorphic nature of the underlying encryption system.
							If we encrypt the 1 into a ciphertext we can re-encrypt the ciphertext into a completely new ciphertext still encrypting the same 1.
							This can be seen below by the upper-index showing how many times a plaintext has been encrypted or re-encrypted respectively.
							The re-encrypted ciphertext is directly decryptable.
							Why this works can easily be seen by observing the additive homomorphic property we have seen before.
							If we take the ciphertext encrypting our 1 we can add an encrypted 0 to it resulting a new ciphertext encrypting the same value.

						<aside class="notes">
							Using re-encryption we just put our ballots through several mix-nets in each re-encrypting the ballots to obfuscate any relation to the older ones.
							In the end we have the encryptions of our ballots in some permuted order known to nobody.

							We have now seen how a generic modern e-voting system works.

						<aside class="notes">
							Let's see how Helios, one of the most well-known e-voting systems, uses these ideas.
							Helios has been used in IACR election and is used throughout academia because of it's simplicity.

							The vote creation step is what differentiates Helios from comparable systems.
							The Benaloh Challenge is much simpler than most other ideas for securing the ballot.

						<aside class="notes">
							The Benaloh Challenge is also called voter-initiated-audit which directly explains the idea of the challenge.
							After encrypting their choice, Alice in this example, the voter is given the choice to either submit, called cast, or audit their ballot.
							If audit is selected the process starts anew. This may be repeated multiple times.
							A random attacker has a 50% chance in every step to guess what the voter will do meaning that it is very unlikely over multiple steps to not be detected. 
							Even though this is challenge is very simple it has some underlying flaws in Helios.

						<h2>Malicious device</h2>

						<h3>Booth audit => Security ✅</h3>
						<h3 class="fragment">Local audit => Security ❌</h3>

						<aside class="notes">
							In a physical booth setting such as a poll station a malicious voting device is correctly detected.
							The device has to physically commit to the encryption by printing it before the choice is shown.
							The challenge does however provide no security in a local setting, for example on your laptop.
							The laptop can show you whatever it wants while submitting a totally different ballot.

							Helios has been extended to fix this problem by two systems, Apollo and Belenios.
							Both of these systems provide verifiability but not the second property we want, privacy.
							Fortunately both have been extended to provide privacy, Apollo quite obviously with PrivApollo, and Belenios with BeleniosVS.
							This thesis combines both PrivApollo and BeleniosVS into a system which is easier to implement, which has been done as part of this thesis.
							As you may remember Helios uses homomorphic tallying but for the implementation we need to use a mix-net.
							Therefore we need a third extension which extends Helios by mix-net based tallying.
							The three systems are combined into the protocol of this thesis called Artemis.
